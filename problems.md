## Internet not working in the WSL linux

The reason this error occurs is because Windows automatically generates `resolv.conf` file with wrong nameserver.

To resolve this issue, follow the following steps.

Locate the file by running the following command:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```
You will see the following in the file:
```
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/resolv.conf
# [network]
# generateResolvConf = false
nameserver xxx.xx.xx
```
Change the nameserver value to `8.8.8.8` and save the file. You should now be able to connect to the internet.
The `8.8.8.8` is the google dns server to resolve the dns names ffrom the local machines

## OR
Run the following command in the CMD

```
netsh winsock reset 
netsh int ip reset all
netsh winhttp reset proxy
ipconfig /flushdns

```
# Mount failed with mount : permission denied by the server
``` bash
<hostname> mount: mount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting *.*.*.*:/home/share

```

### firstly check the nfs server is showing the exports
``` bash
showmount -e <servername>
```
### Include insecure option in /etc/exports on NFS server like below:

``` bash
# cat /etc/exports 
/home/export *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,insecure)
# exportfs -rav
```
### Check the status of the server
``` bash
rpcinfo -p <nfs-server-ip>
```
