## Internet not working in the WSL linux

The reason this error occurs is because Windows automatically generates `resolv.conf` file with wrong nameserver.

To resolve this issue, follow the following steps.

Locate the file by running the following command:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```
You will see the following in the file:
```
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/resolv.conf
# [network]
# generateResolvConf = false
nameserver xxx.xx.xx
```
Change the nameserver value to `8.8.8.8` and save the file. You should now be able to connect to the internet.
